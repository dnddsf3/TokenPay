        - Set up monitoring tools (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCP Stackdriver).
        - Optimize infrastructure for cost and performance.
    - Backend and Frontend Developers:
        - Fix bugs identified during testing.

- **Deliverables**:
    - Production-ready application.
    - Monitoring and alerting configured.
    - Training materials for end-users.

---

### **Scalability Options**

#### **Initial Phase (Small Scale)**:
- Deploy on a single cloud provider with essential resources:
    - Compute: EC2 (AWS), App Service (Azure), or Compute Engine (GCP).
    - Storage: Relational databases for structured data (e.g., RDS, Azure SQL).
    - Notifications: Basic email notifications via SES or SendGrid.

#### **Mid-Scale (After Phase 1)**:
- Scale infrastructure to handle **increased user activity and file processing**:
    - Autoscaling groups or Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE) for load balancing.
    - Use NoSQL databases for high-throughput operations (e.g., DynamoDB, Cosmos DB).
    - Add Redis or Memcached for caching frequent data.

#### **Enterprise Scale**:
- Focus on global distribution and redundancy:
    - Multi-region deployments for high availability.
    - Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for static assets.
    - Advanced threat protection (e.g., AWS Shield, Azure Sentinel).
